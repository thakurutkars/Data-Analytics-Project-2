👩‍💼 HR Analytics Dashboard
This HR analytics project focuses on deriving actionable insights from an employee dataset. I built interactive HR Dashboards using MS Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and performed deep data analysis using SQL queries.

📌 Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to support HR decision-making by analyzing workforce data and visualizing trends in:

Employee Distribution & Demographics

Attrition and Retention Rates

Departmental Headcount

Tenure & Experience Analysis

Gender & Age Breakdown

🛠 Tools Used
MS Excel: For data cleaning, pivot analysis, and dashboard creation.

Power BI: For dynamic visuals, slicers, and interactivity.

Tableau: For advanced visual storytelling and trend analysis.

SQL: For data exploration and query-based insights.

📊 Key Features
Cleaned and prepared raw employee data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Wrote SQL queries to extract answers for key HR questions:

Which departments have the highest attrition or growth?

What is the average tenure per department or job role?

How is the workforce distributed across age and gender categories?

Built dashboards on all platforms (Excel, Power BI, Tableau) to visualize:

KPIs like Total Employees, Attrition Rate, Avg Tenure

Department-wise headcount and turnover

Age and gender demographic charts

Monthly and yearly attrition trends
